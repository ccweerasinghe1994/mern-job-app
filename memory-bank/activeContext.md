# Active Context - MERN Job Application

## Current Work Focus
Initial memory bank setup and project analysis. The project appears to be a fully-featured MERN stack job tracking application with the following current state:

### Recent Analysis
- **Backend Structure**: Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- **Frontend Structure**: Modern React setup with TypeScript and proper component organization
- **Development Setup**: Configured for concurrent development with TypeScript compilation

## Current Project State

### Backend Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Completed Components**:
- Express server setup with TypeScript
- MongoDB connection and Mongoose models
- JWT authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- User and Job models with proper schemas
- Route structure for all major endpoints
- Middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling
- Security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, sanitization)

### Frontend Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Completed Components**:
- React application with TypeScript
- React Router setup with multiple pages
- Component structure (pages, components, hooks)
- Context for dashboard state management
- Styling with styled-components
- Theme support (dark/light mode)

### Key Features Identified
1. **User Management**: Registration, login, logout, profile
2. **Job Tracking**: CRUD operations for job applications
3. **Dashboard**: Statistics and job overview
4. **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based auth system

## Next Steps
Based on the current project structure, potential next steps could include:

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure MongoDB connection is properly configured
2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Verify API endpoints are properly connected
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend
4. **Deployment**: Prepare for production deployment
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and user guides

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout for type safety
- **JWT Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies for security
- **Mongoose ODM**: For MongoDB integration with schema validation
- **React Context**: For global state management
- **Styled Components**: For CSS-in-JS styling

### Design Patterns in Use
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of models, controllers, and routes
- **Middleware Chain**: Layered request processing
- **Component Composition**: Reusable React components
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic for context consumption

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Backend**: Organized by feature (controllers, routes, middleware, models)
- **Frontend**: Component-based structure with shared utilities
- **Types**: Centralized type definitions shared between frontend/backend

### Development Workflow
- **Concurrent Development**: Backend and frontend run simultaneously
- **Hot Reloading**: Both TypeScript compilation and React updates
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: JWT with HTTP-only cookies
- **Validation**: Input validation on both client and server
- **Sanitization**: MongoDB injection prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Modern MERN Stack**: Uses latest versions of React, Node.js, and MongoDB
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Seamless type sharing between frontend/backend
3. **Security First**: Multiple layers of security middleware
4. **Developer Experience**: Excellent development setup with concurrent processes

### Project Structure Insights
1. **Scalability**: Well-organized structure supports future growth
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides excellent developer experience
4. **Modern Tooling**: Vite, React Query, and latest React patterns

## Current Environment Status
- **Package Manager**: PNPM for both frontend and backend
- **Development Mode**: Configured for concurrent development
- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation with watch mode
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM integration

## Memory Bank Status
‚úÖ **Completed**: All core memory bank files created
- `projectbrief.md`: Project overview and requirements
- `productContext.md`: User needs and business context
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns  
- `techContext.md`: Technology stack and tools
- `activeContext.md`: Current state and active work (this file)
