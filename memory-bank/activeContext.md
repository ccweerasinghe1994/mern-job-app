# Active Context - MERN Job Application

## Current Work Focus
Comprehensive TypeScript types system implementation and frontend authentication integration. Major progress has been made on establishing a robust type-safe development environment.

### Recent Achievements
- **Types Folder Structure**: Complete TypeScript types organization implemented
- **Path Aliases**: Configured clean import paths with @ aliases
- **Register Functionality**: Working registration with form validation and toast notifications
- **Development Setup**: Enhanced Vite configuration with proper aliases and TypeScript support

## Current Project State

### Backend Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Completed Components**:
- Express server setup with TypeScript
- MongoDB connection and Mongoose models
- JWT authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- User and Job models with proper schemas
- Route structure for all major endpoints
- Middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling
- Security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, sanitization)
- Working registration endpoint with proper validation

### Frontend Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Completed Components**:
- React application with TypeScript
- **NEW**: Comprehensive types folder with shared/components/api types
- **NEW**: Path aliases for clean imports (@/types, @/components, etc.)
- **NEW**: Working registration form with React Router actions
- **NEW**: Toast notifications integration (react-toastify)
- **NEW**: Enhanced vite-env.d.ts with proper module declarations
- React Router setup with multiple pages
- Component structure (pages, components, hooks)
- Context for dashboard state management
- Styling with styled-components
- Theme support (dark/light mode)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **User Registration**: Complete registration flow with validation and feedback
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types shared between frontend/backend
3. **Development Experience**: Path aliases, hot reloading, concurrent development
4. **Error Handling**: Toast notifications and proper error responses

## Next Steps
Priority focus areas for continued development:

1. **Login Implementation**: Complete the login form and authentication flow
2. **Dashboard Integration**: Connect authenticated users to dashboard features
3. **Job Management**: Implement CRUD operations for job applications
4. **API Integration**: Connect all frontend forms to backend endpoints
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing suite

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Recent Architecture Decisions
- **Types Organization**: Implemented 4-file structure (shared, components, api, index)
- **Path Aliases**: Added comprehensive @ aliases for all major folders
- **Strict TypeScript**: Using const assertions instead of enums for erasableSyntaxOnly
- **Form Handling**: React Router actions for server-side form processing
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for user feedback

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Frontend**: Uses strict settings with erasableSyntaxOnly and verbatimModuleSyntax
- **Path Mapping**: Clean imports with @ aliases in both vite.config.ts and tsconfig
- **Type-only Imports**: Required by verbatimModuleSyntax setting
- **Shared Types**: Consistent types between frontend and backend

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Types Organization Pattern
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Clean imports using path aliases
import type { IJob, JobStatus, API_ENDPOINTS } from '@/types';

// ‚úÖ Type-safe constants with const assertions
export const JOB_STATUS = {
  PENDING: 'pending',
  INTERVIEW: 'interview', 
  DECLINED: 'declined',
} as const;
```

### Form Handling Pattern
- React Router actions for server-side processing
- FormData API for collecting form inputs
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Axios integration with proper error handling

### Development Workflow Enhancement
- **Concurrent Development**: Backend TypeScript watch + server + frontend
- **Path Aliases**: Consistent @ imports across the application
- **Type Safety**: Shared types prevent frontend/backend misalignment
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant updates for both TypeScript compilation and React

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Types Architecture**: Well-organized types dramatically improve development experience
2. **Path Aliases**: Clean imports make code more maintainable and professional
3. **Strict TypeScript**: const assertions work better than enums for strict configs
4. **Form Actions**: React Router actions provide excellent server-side form handling

### Development Experience Improvements
1. **Autocomplete**: Comprehensive types enable excellent IDE support
2. **Error Prevention**: Type safety catches many errors at compile time
3. **Code Organization**: Clear structure makes finding and updating code easy
4. **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation for API contracts

## Current Environment Status
- **Types System**: ‚úÖ Complete with 4-file organization and comprehensive coverage
- **Path Aliases**: ‚úÖ Configured in both Vite and TypeScript configs
- **Registration Flow**: ‚úÖ Working end-to-end with validation and notifications
- **Development Setup**: ‚úÖ Enhanced with better TypeScript support and imports
- **Backend Integration**: ‚úÖ Registration endpoint connected and functional

## Memory Bank Status
‚úÖ **All Core Files Created**: Complete memory bank system established
üìù **Ready for Update**: Types implementation and registration progress documented

## Recent Code Changes Summary
1. **Types Folder**: Created comprehensive type definitions in client/src/types/
2. **Vite Config**: Added path aliases for clean imports
3. **TypeScript Config**: Enhanced with path mapping and strict settings  
4. **Registration**: Implemented complete registration flow with validation
5. **Toast Integration**: Added react-toastify for user notifications
6. **Environment Types**: Enhanced vite-env.d.ts with proper module declarations
