## Current Status üìä

### Implementation Completeness
- **Backend Core**: ~90% complete (structure and logic implemented)
- **Frontend Core**: ~80% complete (components and routing ready)
- **Types System**: ~100% complete (comprehensive types implemented)
- **Authentication**: ~60% complete (registration done, login needed)
- **Database Layer**: ~90% complete (models and connections ready)
- **Development Setup**: ~100% complete (full dev environment ready)

### Priority Items
1. **Login Implementation**: Complete authentication flow
2. **Dashboard Protection**: Implement route guards
3. **Job CRUD Operations**: Connect job management to backend
4. **React Query Setup**: Implement data fetching patterns
5. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Global error management

## Known Issues üêõ

### Current Issues
- **Login Not Implemented**: Registration works but login form needs completion
- **Dashboard Access**: Currently accessible without authentication
- **API Integration**: Custom fetch instance needs full configuration
- **React Query**: Not yet configured for data management

### Development Environment
- **Types Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved with new types system
- **Path Aliases**: Working correctly in both development and build
- **Hot Reloading**: Functioning properly with new configuration

## Evolution of Project Decisions üìà

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Initial Decision**: Separate TypeScript projects for frontend/backend
2. **Refinement**: Shared type definitions for consistency
3. **Enhancement**: Comprehensive middleware stack for security
4. **Optimization**: Concurrent development setup for efficiency
5. **NEW**: Path aliases for clean imports and better developer experience
6. **NEW**: Strict TypeScript configuration with const assertions

### Technology Choices
1. **Database**: MongoDB chosen for flexibility with job application data
2. **Authentication**: JWT with HTTP-only cookies for security
3. **Frontend State**: React Context chosen over Redux for simplicity
4. **Styling**: Styled Components for CSS-in-JS approach
5. **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, standard TypeScript for backend
