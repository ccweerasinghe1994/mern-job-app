# Project Brief - MERN Job Application

## Project Overview
A full-stack job tracking application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) using TypeScript. The application allows users to manage their job applications, track application status, and view statistics about their job search progress.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Secure login/logout functionality
   - User profile management
   - Role-based access (User/Admin)

2. **Job Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete job applications
   - Track job status (Pending, Interview, Declined)
   - Support different job types (Full-time, Part-time, Remote, Internship)
   - Associate jobs with specific users

3. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - User dashboard with job overview
   - Statistics and charts for job applications
   - Search and filter capabilities

### Technical Requirements
1. **Backend (Node.js/Express/TypeScript)**
   - RESTful API design
   - JWT-based authentication
   - MongoDB integration with Mongoose
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, sanitization)

2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
   - Modern React with hooks and context
   - React Router for navigation
   - Styled Components for styling
   - React Query for state management
   - Responsive design with dark theme support

3. **Development Setup**
   - TypeScript throughout the stack
   - Concurrent development with nodemon
   - Vite for frontend build tooling
   - ESLint for code quality

## Success Criteria
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Full CRUD operations for job applications
- Responsive, user-friendly interface
- Real-time data synchronization
- Proper error handling and validation
- Production-ready deployment capability

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Styled Components
- **Authentication**: JWT with HTTP-only cookies
- **Development**: Concurrently, Nodemon, ESLint
